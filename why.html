  <h1>Why this project</h1>
<p>It's been now a few years that we are aware of the risks of having all of our privacy exposed. The main risk being the difficulties to fight back the sliding of a democracy into a totalitarian regime. What we do in our private time is what gives us the ability to prevent such a sliding.</p>

<p>We need tools easy to use that give to every citizen the ability to manage by themselves their private data. Those data being stored at their home, or wherever they want.</p>

<p>Such tools must satisfy the statement : "You are the only one able to give away information about yourself".</p>


  <h1>Example</h1>
<p>A good example is the PRISM project by which the NSA gets access to all the data from most of the major web companies. The main issues being why does the American government need all these data about everyone. Why did it take a whistleblower for us to discover it?</p>

<p>The solution to this situation is of course political. We need to determine what is OK for governments to do and what is not.</p>

<p>Nevertheless even with those issues cleared we won't have any guaranties about what the secret services do and don't do. The only guaranty for us is to be the only one able to give away information about ourselves.</p>
