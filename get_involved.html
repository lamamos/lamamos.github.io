<h1>Get involved</h1>

<p>You don't need to know how to code to help the project. The first thing you can do is just talk to people. Not necessary about this project, but about the issues we are facing (cf the <a href="/why.html">why page</a>.). One needs to see a problem before starting to solve it.</p>

<p>Then if you want to contribute more directly to the project you can report us any strange things in the software. That mean any bugs (the soft doesn't do what I want it to do), but also features you'd like to see added to the software.</p>

<p>The goal of lamamos is to provide tools usable by anyone. That mean that everything must be translated into every imaginable languages. If you'd like to translate a part of the software in an language that is not yet supported, you can add it to this <a href="https://github.com/lamamos/lamadmin/blob/develop/include/translation.js">file</a>a>. If you are not confterble with git and thos coding tools just send us a mail we can simplify the task for you.</p>

<p>You might have guessed that the design and graphisme of the site and everything until now have been done by a developper. You think you can do better, just do it and send us the result by <a href="mailto:lamamos@freelists.org">mail</a>. If you have any questions just ask us by mail also. ;)</p>

<p>An other way to make the project accessible is to write documentation addapted to every public. Don't hesitate to write your own tutorials, and to contribute the the documentations of the project which is <a href="https://github.com/lamamos/lamamos.github.io/wiki">here</a>.</p>

<p>Finaly just fork a project and start toying around with it. Break it, repear it, improuve it and send us a pull request. The project page is <a href="https://github.com/lamamos">here</a>.</p>
