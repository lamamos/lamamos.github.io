<h1>Get involved</h1>

<p>You don't need to know how to code to help the project. The first thing you can do is just to talk to people. Not necessarily about this project, but about the issues we are facing (cf the <a href="/why.html">why page</a>). One needs to see a problem before starting to solve it.</p>

<p>Then if you want to contribute more directly to the project here is a few thingth that would benefit from your help : </p>

<h2>Bug report</h2>
<p>you can report us any strange things in the software. That means any bugs (the soft doesn't do what I want it to do), but also features you'd like to see added to the software. For that you can post issues on the <a href="https://github.com/lamamos/lamamos_installation_script/issues">github repo</a>, or if you are confused by this interface just email us : <a href="mailto:lamamos@freelists.org">lamamos@freelists.org</a></p>

<h2>Translation</h2>
<p>The goal of Lamamos is to provide tools usable by anyone. That means that everything must be translated into every imaginable languages. If you'd like to translate a part of the software in an language that is not yet supported, you can add it to that <a href="https://github.com/lamamos/lamadmin/blob/develop/include/translation.js">file</a>. If you are not comfortable with git and these coding tools just send us a mail we can simplify the task for you : <a href="mailto:lamamos@freelists.org">lamamos@freelists.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Graphical design and GUI design</h2>
<p>You might have guessed that the design, logo and visuals of the site and everything until now have been done by a developer. You think you can do better, just do it and send us the result by <a href="mailto:lamamos@freelists.org">mail</a>. If you have any questions just ask us by mail at : <a href="mailto:lamamos@freelists.org">lamamos@freelists.org</a>. ;)</p>

<h2>Videos</h2>
<p>Vidéos are awesome to convai ideas easily and fast. This project needs more of those thingh and especialy better ones than the one on the home page. You would like to give it a shot, or just give us some ideas or tips on how to do it well, just email us : <a href="mailto:lamamos@freelists.org">lamamos@freelists.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>An other way to make the project accessible is to write documentation addapted to every public. Don't hesitate to write your own tutorials, and to contribute to the documentations of the project which is <a href="https://github.com/lamamos/lamamos.github.io/wiki">here</a>.</p>

<h2>New tools for the community</h2>
<p>This project would greatly benefit from the use of some tools. To make it more accesible to peaple who are not developpers for exemple. Here is a list of project that could be usefull : </p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a translation interface to make translation accessible to peaple who don't code. Like transifex.com for example.</li>
  <li>Create a way for peaple to easily request new features. And vote on which one they want to see implemented first. (using the issues API of github for example)</li>
  <li>Find a good mailing list server (better than freelists.org)</li>
  <li>Insert your idea here.</li>
</ul>

You would like to start working on one of those issues, or would like to add a new one to this list. Then send us a mail so that we can start and discuss about it and start exchanging ideas : <a href="mailto:lamamos@freelists.org">lamamos@freelists.org</a>.


<h2>Toying around</h2>
<p>Finaly just fork a project and start toying around with it. Break it, repear it, improve it and send us a pull request. The project page is <a href="https://github.com/lamamos">here</a>.</p>
