<h1>In a few words</h1>
Lamamos is a project dedicated to one mission : give citizens the tools they need to properly defend their privacy on the internet. For that we are developing an operating system installable and usable by anyone, that deploys your own cloud servers. Indeed servers with an 's'. We think that self-hosting is the only way we may guarantee our privacy, but we don't want to sacrifice the quality of service. On the contrary we want to improve by giving you the ability to control all the parameters of those services.

<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Redundancy in your servers : if one fails the other one will do the job at its place.</li>
  <li>Based on free softwares : you know what is running on your machines.</li>
  <li>You are your own service-provider : the only one who can give away information about yourself is you.</li>
</ul>
