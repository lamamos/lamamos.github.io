<h1>Presentation</h1>
<p>In this tutorial we are going to install for the first time a lamamos system. That means that we are going to install lamamos on two computers and we are going to make them into a redundant system.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this tutorial we are using two virtuals machines each one running a fresh install of debian.</p>

<h1>Building the VMs</h1>

<p>First of all, we are going to create the virtual machine (VM) on which we are going to install lamamos. In the end we want to end up with two VMs. But we can easily clone them so we are going to install what we need on one and then clone it to get the second server.</p>

<p>During this tutorial I will be using virtualbox. I am certain that other virtualisation software does exactly the same things but those things might be called differently.</p>

<p>First of all, we are going to create a new VM. We don't need much to make it 1G of RAM will be plenty and a hard drive of 10G will be enough for a test VM (7G for the system, 2G for the users' data and 1G of SWAP). Finally we are going to configure the networks. We need two connections : one to the internet (to fetch the softwares) and one to the other VM (to synchronise with it). To do so we are going to have to create a local network. In virtualbox go to file/preferences, select the network tab and add a new one to the list. Back into the configuration of your VM go to the network tab, leave the first network carte in NAT mode and go to the second network card and activate it in host-only adaptater. By default it is going to select the network we just created.</p>

<p>We are ready to launch the VM. When you will do that you will be asked to provide an installation disc. Just pop in a regular <a href="https://www.debian.org/">debian</a>. During the installation you will be asked a few questions :
<ul>
  <li>What is the primary network : The primary adaptater is the one connected to internet in our case it is the one in NAT mode, so the 1st one (eth0).</li>
  <li>What is the name and hostname of the machine : leave it as default we will configure it later.</li>
  <li>Hard drive configuration : we want 3 partitions : 8G as the root file systeme. 1.7G not mounted anywhere (that partition will be shared between the servers). Finally 1G as SWAP.</li>
  <li>When asked which softwares we want to be installed remove everything exept the standard system utilities (who needs windows when you've got lamas)</li>
</ul>
</p>



<h1>Configuring the network</h1>
<p>You are going to have to configure the network of the two VMs. First of all clone the VM you just created. You now should be having 2 exactly identic VMs. We can launch one of them, log into it, and edit the file : /etc/network/interfaces. This file should already contain the configuration of the network connected to eth0 (our NAT network). We are going to add the configuration for the second network (the one that let the VMs communicate whith each other). We just have to add at the end of this file :</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
allow-hotplug eth1
iface eth1 inet static
        address 192.168.56.250
        netmast 255.255.255.0
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You can of course set whatever IP adress you want, as long as it is compatible with the network you just created (in the virtualbox configuration). In my case I can use every IPs in the network : 192.168.56.</p>

<p>We are going to do the same thing whith the second VM, but we need to configure it with an other IP than the first server. Keep those IPs written somewhere, they will be asked latter during the installation process. We just need to make sure that this new configuration is used by the VMs, so we need to reboot them.</p>


<h1>Getting lamamos</h1>

<p>To get the last version of the lamamos project, the simplest way is to clone directly the git repo :</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
git clone https://github.com/lamamos/lamamos_installation_script.git
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In this folder you just got to launch the installation script :</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
./install_lamamos.sh
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This installation is going to ask you a few questions among which :
<ul>
  <li>The hostname of the servers : This value will be configured by the script itself.</li>
  <li>The IP of the servers : the ones we just configured.</li>
  <li>The partition that will be used for the datas (and will be shared accross the servers).</li>
  <li>The IP that will be shared between the servers.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Once this configuration is done, the script is going to launch a bunch of installations, configurations and finaly launch Rex for the first time. Rex is the software that is in charge of maintaining the configuration of the servers. After a bunch of installations Rex is going to reboot the VMs. At that point the installation is not done yet. Rex needs to be relaunched, you can wait for it (it is going to hapend every 30 minutes), or if you don't want to wait, you can do (on both VMs) :</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
cd /etc/lamamos/rex/
rex configure
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Once this is done you should have a fully functionning lamamos system. That mean redundancy in the applications : if one server fails, the other one going to take it's place. That also means redundancy in the data. You can play with it by adding file in the folder /data, and noticing the fact they are created on the other servers also (I talk about a shared volume, but it is not. Each server is accessing local data. But every modification made to this data is reproduced onto the other server.).</p>

<h1>Lamadmin</h1>

<p>You can access the configuration interface of the servers at the IP that is shared by the servers.</p>
